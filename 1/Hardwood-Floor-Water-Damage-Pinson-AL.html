<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call an expert rapidly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. Water damage, water invasion, building envelope problems, and building and construction defects are an extremely major matter. Here in Portland, Oregon, Vancouver, Washington and the surrounding locations are experiencing countless issues due to dripping windows and doors, water and wind driven rain damage. Senior living centers, apartments, condos, townhomes, hotels, commercial structures are particularly vulnerable to these problems as typically the contractor farms out the outside envelope work and wall assembly procedure, for that reason leading to expenses and corners being cut.</p>

Water vapor commonly condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to flourish. 8 This wetness vapor passes through walls and ceilings, typically condensing during the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" detects wetness from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as refined concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
