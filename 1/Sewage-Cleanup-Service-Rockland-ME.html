Flooding, dripping roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can result in interior mold development. Water vapor typically condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to grow. 8 This moisture vapor goes through ceilings and walls, usually condensing throughout the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone.
