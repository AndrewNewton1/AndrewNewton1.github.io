<h3>Commercial Water Damage Normal IL 61761</h3>
<p>Mold likes to grow in your house's attic and crawl areas, but what brought the mold in the first place? The short answer: darkness and the presence of wetness in the environment. Stone floors need less time to change than water damaged hardwood floors. A total floor replacement can be anticipated to be completed in four to 10 days. Water damaged walls frequently peel and might need both repair and repainting; the latter service needs a number of hours.<p>
<p>Current Review: We called them out to examine water damage in our kitchen area after we found our faucet was dripping. They fasted to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They established a makeshift kitchen area for us in our living room and transported away whatever else.  We were extremely delighted that we didn't have to lift a finger.  When they came back the next service day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were extremely professional and hardworking.  I could not believe they got so much performed in one day!  Someone has actually come out every day to sign in and I feel confident in their understanding and abilities to finish the job properly. I would recommend them in a heart beat.<p>
