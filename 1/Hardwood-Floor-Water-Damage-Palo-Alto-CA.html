The consistent and falling rates of drying materials require different criteria for altering conditions.</p>
<p>If it's covered by your policy, your insurance company will ask you questions about your claim that will help them decide. An adjuster will then be dispatched to assess the damage. If you need to make any urgent repair work prior to the adjuster has a chance to see the damage, make certain pictures are taken before the repair work are done, and that you keep the invoices for any materials you purchased.</p>
