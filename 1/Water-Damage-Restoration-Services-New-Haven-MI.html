Flooding, leaky roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can cause interior mold growth. Water vapor commonly condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to grow. 8 This moisture vapor passes through walls and ceilings, normally condensing during the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone.

How quick the deterioration procedure takes depends upon a lots of factors we have no control over, like humidity, the intensity of the spill, and for how long the gadget stayed in contact with the liquid.
