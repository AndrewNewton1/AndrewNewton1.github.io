<p>Drying Out: Once the mold is contained in a space, we proceed to clear it out and then dry off the moisture. For soft, washable items, such as clothes and bed linen, first decide if the product is worth keeping. Smoke is challenging to fully remove, and you might have more important things to spend time on. Several wash cycles - without letting the products dry in between - might be required. We'll look after every detail when it concerns fire and smoke restoration, consisting of the removal of soot, odor, particles, hazardous toxins, water, and fixing structural damage.<p>
