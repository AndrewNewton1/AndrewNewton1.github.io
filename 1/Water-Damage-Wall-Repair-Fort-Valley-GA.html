Using a putty knife, work the paper edge down into the compound. Plume the edges of the compound and enable it to dry. Sand lightly with a fine-grit sandpaper and use a 2nd layer of joint substance to complete the repair.

<p>Mold Examination Sciences of Seattle focuses on mold examination, mold detection, and mold screening We do not carry out mold remediation, therefore there are no conflicts of interest. When using and vacuuming air scrubbers for mold remediation, the filters utilized need to be HEPA (High Effectiveness Particulate Air). Only HEPA filters are developed to capture particles as little as mold spores. Regular filters will not work, and could make the problem even worse.<p>
