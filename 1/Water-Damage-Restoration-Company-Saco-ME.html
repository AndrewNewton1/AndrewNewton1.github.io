<p>Water intrusion into structures can be incredibly damaging. Jake and his men were incredible in helping us make it through flooding from Hurricane Florence. They fasted to get to the house and started drying out our soaked crawlspace immediately. They came back every day (typically twice a day) to monitor and adjust the dehumidifiers and fans to maximize the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They discussed whatever they were doing along the way and also were extremely helpful in collaborating efforts with the insurance coverage adjuster. They were more than fair on the expenses and I 'd advise them without hesitation.</p>
