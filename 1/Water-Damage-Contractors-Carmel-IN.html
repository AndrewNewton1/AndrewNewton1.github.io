<h3>Fire Damage Repair in Carmel</h3>
<p>When you are preparing big repairs, keep in mind that drywall features a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the remainder of the sheet. By lowering the thickness here, it's easier to hide long taped seams under several coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the remainder of the sheet. In order to get an even, completed appearance, it is necessary to prevent joining bound edges to butt edges. Also bear in mind that considering that wall studs are vertical, drywall is normally connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This assists enhance the strength of the wall and helps separate vertical seams in the drywall that tend to be more visible even when the job is finished.<p>
