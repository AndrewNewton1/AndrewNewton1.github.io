<p>Remember that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet when you are preparing big repairs. By lowering the thickness here, it's simpler to conceal long taped joints under a number of coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the remainder of the sheet. In order to get an even, completed look, it is very important to prevent joining bound edges to butt edges. Likewise keep in mind that since wall studs are vertical, drywall is usually connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This helps enhance the strength of the wall and helps separate vertical seams in the drywall that tend to be more obvious even when the task is finished.<p>
