<p>Tape over the seams with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape seems to be more convenient because it is self-adhesive, numerous expert drywall installers choose paper tape. While I'm not a professional, I choose paper tape, too. Nevertheless, paper tape isn't constantly convenient. Using paper tape needs some practice and little skill, but it's well worth discovering. Once the meters check out wetness levels equal to the previous dry state of the room, the specialist will eliminate the fans and dehumidifiers from the location. At this point, the water remediation procedure is considered to complete.<p>
<p>If you're dealing with a smaller sized hole (up to 6"), apply a thin layer of joint compound around the hole. Put your spot into the hole. Utilizing a putty knife, work the paper edge down into the compound. Plume the edges of the compound and permit it to dry. Sand lightly with a fine-grit sandpaper and apply a 2nd layer of joint compound to complete the repair. As water and storm damage professionals, we have the experience and advanced training that allows us to restore your home quickly. We use scientific drying concepts and offer validation and documents that your residential or commercial property is dry and the task is complete.<p>
