<p>If the wet iPhone remains in a case, remove it; take the SIM card out too.

<p>We called them out to assess water damage in our kitchen area after we found our faucet was dripping. They fasted to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift kitchen for us in our living room and carried away whatever else.  We were very happy that we didn't have to raise a finger.  When they returned the next organisation day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were really professional and hardworking.  I couldn't think they got a lot done in one day!  Somebody has actually come out every day to sign in and I feel great in their knowledge and abilities to do the job effectively. I would recommend them in a heart beat.<p>
