<h3>Fire And Water Restoration in Beachwood</h3>
<p>Get rid of paneling, plaster and wallboard to a minimum of the flood level. When damp, Wallboard acts like a sponge. If soaked by contaminated floodwater, it can be a long-term health threat and should be eliminated. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This creates a "chimney effect" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but utilize only the idea of the blade and look out for pipes, ductwork and circuitry.<p>
