<p>Mold can cause serious health concerns through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you may not understand is that most chemicals, consisting of bleach, have been proven inadequate versus getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it actually facilitates mold growth. The chlorine particles stay on the surface and will only kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>After the water and wetness have actually been removed the next action to repair water damage is to clean and sterilize the affected locations. Flood water often brings sewage and other contaminants with it. These impurities should be eliminated before final repairs are performed. Commercial cleaners and industrial sanitizers will make sure that your home is effectively cleaned and dealt with.</p>

<p>Class 3 - greatest amount of absorption, evaporation, and water. Water intrusion where damp, permeable materials (e.g., carpet, gypsum board, fiber-fill insulation, concrete masonry system (CMU), fabrics) represent more than ~ 40% of the combined floor, wall, and ceiling area in the area; and where products described as low evaporation materials (e.g., plaster, wood, concrete, masonry) or low evaporation assemblies (e.g., multilayer wallboard, multilayer subfloors, gym floors, or other complex, built-up assemblies) have absorbed minimal moisture.</p>
<p>Once standing water is eliminated, the goal or our drying equipment is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in locations where water has actually soaked up (this will briefly increase the humidity in the impacted spaces) and b) remove the moisture in the air with powerful dehumidifiers. There might be times when the rate of evaporation is a little out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our tracking procedure consists of examining ambient conditions both inside and out, and if we can take advantage of low humidity outdoors, we might choose to open a window or door to briefly purge" the damp air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly depending on temperature too, so cooling a space down with outdoor air can likewise set a drying task back days. If you have questions on this, we ask that you please inquire with our service technicians before you make any modifications.</p>
