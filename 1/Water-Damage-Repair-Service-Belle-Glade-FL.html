<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. Sometimes it will be apparent that you have water leaking either behind your walls or onto the ceiling from above.

Other times, you might see small signs like coffee-colored discolorations that may expand with time.</p>
<p>Another drawback of bleach is that it can damage the products it's utilized on as it is a severe, destructive chemical.

For these reasons try to avoid using bleach and if you should utilize it, just use it on non-porous surface areas.</p>
