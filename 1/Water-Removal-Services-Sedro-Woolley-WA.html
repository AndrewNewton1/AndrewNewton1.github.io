<p>For the victims caught up in or affected by a fire, whether at home or work, it can be one of the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Try to find noticeable mold development (it might look cottony, velvety, rough, or leathery and have different colors like white, gray, brown, black, yellow, or green). Mold frequently looks like a staining or fuzzy development on furniture or structure materials (walls, ceilings, or anything made from wood or paper). Try to find signs of moisture or water damage (water leaks, standing water, water stains, condensation, and so on).</p>
<p>Since common structure materials are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold growth in an indoor environment is usually connected to water or moisture exposure and may be triggered by incomplete drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can lead to interior mold growth. Water vapor commonly condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor passes through walls and ceilings, typically condensing during the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" spots wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as polished concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
