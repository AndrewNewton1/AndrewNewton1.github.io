<p>Drywall is in fact a panel of plaster (calcium sulfate dihydrate) that is sandwiched between 2 kinds of paper (one is a light-colored facer, the other the darker backer). It was very first appeared in the U.S. in 1916 when United States Plaster Corporation put out an item called Sheetrock" meant to be a non-warping, non-burning wall covering. Since it went up rapidly without the need for wood lathe, the item was billed as the poor man's response to plaster walls" By the 1950s and 60s, drywall had ended up being a standard building material.</p>
<p>We will do our best to restore your contents to a pre-loss condition. Some items, when exposed to water for a time period, end up being permanently damaged (i.e. they will never be the same). Other products might simply need to be decontaminated and relocated to high ground. Soft items like clothing, bedspreads, drapes can be sent to a laundry service that we can arrange for you. Another point is, there are different levels of contamination with water (see Categories of Water), and that will factor into the formula of what can be conserved and what must be replaced. We will work with you throughout the loss, reserving products that we feel can not be effectively restored so you can make a list to develop into your insurance adjuster. Your Adjuster will then figure out a compensation for your products according to the regards to your policy.</p>
