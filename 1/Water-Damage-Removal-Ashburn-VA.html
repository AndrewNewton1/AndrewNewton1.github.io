Did you know that smoke is actually made of little particles of the fire itself? It's a harmful, hot substance that can damage the surfaces it touches, simply as fire does. Many people think that since smoke increases into the air, diffusion occurs, and it merely disappears. While diffusion-- the spread of a substance from high concentration to lower concentration-- does occur, this indicates that the smoke will spread, damaging a much larger location than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is allowed to exist, the more comprehensive the smoke damage will be. The best smoke damage restoration approaches will include browsing a wide area to tidy up and repair smoke damage.</p>
