<h3>Fire Restoration Experts in Fremont</h3>
<p>When you are planning big repair work, remember that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the remainder of the sheet. By minimizing the density here, it's easier to conceal long taped seams under numerous coats of joint substance. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the remainder of the sheet. In order to get an even, completed appearance, it's important to avoid joining bound edges to butt edges. Also remember that because wall studs are vertical, drywall is normally connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This helps strengthen the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical seams in the drywall that tend to be more obvious even when the task is ended up.<p>
