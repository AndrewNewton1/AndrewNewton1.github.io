<p>The location that is being dealt with is sealed, as mold spores can easily travel when they are interrupted. Air purification systems are normally used in conjunction with the sealing of the location to get rid of as many air-borne spores as possible and to avoid spread. Sealing the location involves using both physical barriers, such as plastic sheeting, in addition to negative atmospheric pressure, which avoids the flow of air between the infected space and the areas around it. All heating, cooling, and fans in the location will be switched off to prevent the mold from spreading out as well.</p>

<p>Recent Review: We called them out to evaluate water damage in our cooking area after we found our faucet was dripping. They were quick to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They established a makeshift kitchen for us in our living room and carried away everything else.  We were extremely happy that we didn't need to raise a finger.  When they came back the next service day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were extremely professional and hardworking.  I couldn't think they got so much done in one day!  Somebody has actually come out every day to check in and I feel great in their knowledge and capabilities to get the job done effectively. I would suggest them in a heart beat.<p>
