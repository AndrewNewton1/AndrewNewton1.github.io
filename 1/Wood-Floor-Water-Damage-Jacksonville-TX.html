<p>When left alone, mold can trigger major health concerns through airborne pathogens. Experts have identified Pennsylvania the center of an industrywide epidemic that has affected sprawling suburban houses, starter homes, and luxury Philadelphia townhouses alike. Characteristics built with materials aside from stucco had issues, too. Some homes with water damage were built by billion-dollar public companies. Others, by little, local companies. Some are 10 or twenty years old. Others are new.</p>
<p>The most essential element of correcting drywall water damage is to avoid additional damage from mold or mildew. When wet drywall sits with inadequate ventilation, mold and mildew occur most frequently. Regardless of the location or extent of the damage, we recommend utilizing dehumidifiers, industrial fans, or comparable makers that can move a large volume of air for maximum ventilation. Standard home fans are not efficient in moving an appropriate amount of air needed to dry a room sufficiently.</p>

Mold can stain things like wood as it grows, leaving behind permanent cosmetic damage even after it is gone. MMR assists Mold Solutions NW address stain issues as well as mold development by getting under the surface area on affected locations.</p>

Any indoor humidity levels 1 above 45 percent could lead 2 to conditions that allow mold nests to develop.</p>
