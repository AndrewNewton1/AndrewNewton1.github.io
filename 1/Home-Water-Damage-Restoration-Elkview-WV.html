<p>Mold loves to grow in your house's attic and crawl spaces, but what brought the mold in the very first location? The short answer: darkness and the existence of moisture in the environment.

Water damaged walls often peel and might need both repair and repainting; the latter service needs numerous hours.<p>
<p>Recent Review: We called them out to examine water damage in our kitchen after we discovered our faucet was leaking. They were quick to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They established a makeshift kitchen area for us in our living room and carried away whatever else.  We were really happy that we didn't have to raise a finger.  When they came back the next company day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were really professional and hardworking.  I could not think they got a lot carried out in one day!  Someone has come out each day to sign in and I feel great in their understanding and abilities to do the job properly. I would recommend them in a heart beat.<p>
