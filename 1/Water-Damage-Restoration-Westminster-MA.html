<p>Any building that has actually struggled with water damage or issues with excess wetness is at danger of mold growth. There is a fantastic video below that I encourage you to enjoy.

<p>Because it's impossible to eliminate mold in your house entirely, it's important to keep your air clear by frequently replacing air filters. Consider utilizing High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filters, which are created to trap 99.97% of particles that are 0.3 microns or bigger (mold is usually 3 - 12 microns) in order to keep mold from circulating. You might also think about an air cleanser that will remove mold spores. Discover one with an antimicrobial filter to make sure that the filter itself stays totally free from mold if you live in a particularly damp environment.</p>
