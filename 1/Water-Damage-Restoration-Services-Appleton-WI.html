<h3>Fire And Smoke Damage in Appleton</h3>
<p>Inspect the drywall to see how much damage has been done. Greatly water-infiltrated wallboard will droop from ceilings or collapse to the touch. Eliminate all jeopardized drywall by hand or utilize the claw end of a hammer or a damaging bar to remove it. They may be repairable by cutting out the damaged part if drywall panels only reveal water discolorations but aren't structurally compromised. When cutting out around the damaged location, utilize a keyhole saw to cut the hole into a square or rectangle-shaped shape. You can then make a spot with another piece of drywall for the repair.<p>

We've received advance training in restoration methods, and we have the experience and customized equipment to rapidly restore your residential or commercial property. Moisture often gets in buildings from little spaces you can't see, and can even enter your home or company from basements and crawlspaces.
