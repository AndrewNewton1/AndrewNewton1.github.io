<h3>Tips to Recover From Fires Caused by Flooding in Madison Heights</h3>
<p>Eliminate plaster, wallboard and paneling to at least the flood level. When damp, Wallboard acts like a sponge. It can be a permanent health threat and should be removed if soaked by polluted floodwater. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This creates a "chimney effect" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but utilize just the suggestion of the blade and watch out for pipes, ductwork and electrical wiring.<p>
<p>Cleaning with bleach and water, or other household disinfectants will not eliminate mold. Attempt to keep yourself, kids, employees and others out of the affected area. Attempting to dry the area with a fan may disrupt the spores and spread them to a new location. Getting rid of black mold is a detailed procedure that requires patience, a financial investment in protective equipment and black mold removal products, and, obviously, the courage to brave dark, confined spaces lived in by harmful fungus.<p>
