<p>Assessment reports and suits by seven next-door neighbors on the block now allege that building flaws allowed water to gush into her walls. In the Shorts' home, a moisture-inspection test showed that some parts of their wall had actually likely disintegrated and developed mold. Paper meant to line the roof, rather than the kind required by the building regulations, was used on the walls. At Jackson's, the stucco was not sufficiently sealed around some pipes, an inspector said, enabling water to trickle in and travel through her walls.</p>
