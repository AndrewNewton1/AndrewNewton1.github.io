<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also known as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become wet or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some stress of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other aspects. When mycotoxins exist, they happen in both living and dead mold spores, and may exist in materials that have actually become infected with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from ending up being air-borne. When the mold dies and dries up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to end up being airborne.</p>

<p>Open doors and windows to get rid of moisture and odors if the weather allows. If the outdoors humidity becomes higher than inside, close things up; similarly, close up your home overnight if temperature levels drop and moist air may otherwise be drawn inside your home. If windows are stuck tight, take off window strips and eliminate whole sash. If doors are stuck, eliminate door hinge pins with a screwdriver and hammer, then eliminate.</p>
<p>Mold spores are discovered almost everywhere, both inside and out. If water or extremely high levels 1 of humidity are present in your house, mold growth can start in as little as 48 hours. Mold spores prosper in moisture, high humidity, and other damp environments. They proliferate into nests when exposed to water. Any indoor humidity levels 1 above 45 percent could lead 2 to conditions that permit mold colonies to develop.</p>

Evaluating for mold may cost as low as $20 for a home kit or as much as $500 for professional screening. Remember, however, that it is frequently baseless, as most remediation services will proceed the same way no matter what kind of mold is found in your home.</p>
