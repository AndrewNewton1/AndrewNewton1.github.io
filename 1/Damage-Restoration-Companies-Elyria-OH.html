<h3>Smoke Clean Up Service in Elyria</h3>
<p>Get rid of plaster, paneling and wallboard to at least the flood level. When damp, Wallboard acts like a sponge. It can be a long-term health danger and should be removed if soaked by infected floodwater.

This develops a "chimney result" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but use just the pointer of the blade and look out for pipelines, ductwork and wiring.<p>
