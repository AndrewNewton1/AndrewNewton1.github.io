<p>Any building that has actually experienced water damage or problems with excess moisture is at risk of mold development. Disintegration to concrete and brick within a home is possible due to prolonged water direct exposure and requires masonry work to repair. Permanent staining on floors and walls is another potential impact of water damage. Walls and flooring may need replacement or refinishing depending on the level of damage. Moldy odors can remain in a home where leaks or flooding have taken place and this might be indicative of excess mold and mildew development.</p>
<p>When water freezes, it expands, which can be an issue for your home. Frozen water can trigger pipelines to burst, leading to untidy and expensive repair. Luckily, there are actions you can require to prevent a water catastrophe. As the temperature drops, keep a consistent drip of water running to help avoid freezing. Pay unique attention to pipes in basements, garages, the back of cabinets, and other locations that might not be getting the exact same quantity of heat as other areas in your house. Wrapping them in a layer of insulation can go a long method in preventing a burst.</p>

Using bleach on noticeable mold development is NOT advised by either the EPA or the CDC and is not part of the ANSI-IICRC S520 Requirement for Specialist Mold Remediation. Initially, bleach is a chemical and can affect individuals with chemical level of sensitivities especially if utilized in areas that are not well ventilated. Second, on non-porous surface areas such as tile, bleach is no more effective at removing mold than a mild cleaning agent and a damp cloth, so we advise the least harmful option.</p>
