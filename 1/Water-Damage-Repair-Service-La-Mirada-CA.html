<p>Water intrusion into buildings can be exceptionally damaging. Jake and his people were fantastic in helping us get through flooding from Typhoon Florence. They were quick to get to your house and started drying our soaked crawlspace immediately. They returned every day (typically two times a day) to monitor and adjust the dehumidifiers and fans to optimize the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They explained everything they were doing along the method and also were very useful in coordinating efforts with the insurance coverage adjuster. They were more than fair on the expenses and I 'd advise them without hesitation.</p>
