Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at first as his schedule was already full, however when he learnt just how much water costs I was paying since the leak began, he consented to assist me out on a Sunday early morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the equipment. He marked the place & discovered of the leakage for me and after that even helped me shut down my primary water valve.
