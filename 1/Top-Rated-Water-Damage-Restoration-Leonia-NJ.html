Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at first as his schedule was currently full, however when he learnt just how much water bill I was paying given that the leak began, he consented to assist me out on a Sunday morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the devices. He found & marked the place of the leak for me and then even assisted me shut down my primary water valve. Extremely polite and easy-going individual.<p>
