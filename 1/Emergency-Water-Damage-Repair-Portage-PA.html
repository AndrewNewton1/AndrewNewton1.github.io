<p>Water invasion into buildings can be extremely damaging. When InstaScope was produced, we engaged a team of researchers at the University of Colorado. Led by Dr. Mark Hernandez, a globally acknowledged professional on the biological elements of air pollution, this team was assigned to verify and check the brand-new technology. Needless to say, it passed with flying colors. Together, we were able to create a brand-new mold-assessment system for commercial customers that, unlike any other approach or device, can deliver scientifically precise, area-by-area results-- and do so instantly. So when you think about all the dangers of mold, InstaScope is a vital tool to help guarantee the health of your home and the health of your household.</p>
