<h3>Fire Damage Repair in Wylie</h3>
<p>Before you clean your home, you need to use appropriate security. Smoke, soot and particles can be hazardous to inhale, so use a respirator if there is considerable soot in the damaged location.

Be mindful of the shoes you're wearing so you do not track soot discolorations into other rooms.<p>
