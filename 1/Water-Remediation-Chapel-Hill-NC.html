<p>3. Licenses and other requirements: Before you get too far along in the basement finishing process, you will want to ensure you comprehend any licenses required.

This produces a chimney effect" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but utilize just the idea of the blade and watch out for pipelines, duct work and circuitry.</p>

Never use soot cleaner or water before you utilize a dry-cleaning sponge, or you could spread out the soot and make it impossible to remove with a chemical sponge. Start cleaning the walls gently with the dry-cleaning sponge. After a couple of strokes, turn the sponge to a different side so you're constantly using a clean surface area. When all sides are stained, trim the sides with a knife to reveal fresh surfaces below. Or simply grab a brand-new sponge. Make sure you use a cleaning motion the entire time. If you scrub the stains, you may spread them and work the soot deeper into the surface area.</p>
