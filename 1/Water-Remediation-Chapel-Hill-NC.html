<p>3. Licenses and other requirements: Before you get too far along in the basement finishing process, you will want to ensure you comprehend any licenses required.

This produces a chimney effect" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but utilize just the idea of the blade and watch out for pipelines, duct work and circuitry.</p>
<p>Next usage the dry-cleaning sponge (chemical sponge) to clean the soot and smoke spots. This phase is important, as these sponges utilize special chemicals to lift stains from walls. Never use soot cleaner or water before you utilize a dry-cleaning sponge, or you could spread out the soot and make it impossible to remove with a chemical sponge. Start cleaning the walls gently with the dry-cleaning sponge. After a couple of strokes, turn the sponge to a different side so you're constantly using a clean surface area. When all sides are stained, trim the sides with a knife to reveal fresh surfaces below. Or simply grab a brand-new sponge. Make sure you use a cleaning motion the entire time. If you scrub the stains, you may spread them and work the soot deeper into the surface area.</p>
