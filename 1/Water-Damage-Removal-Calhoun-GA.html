<h3>Why You Should Hire Calhoun Professionals for Your Fire Damage</h3>
<p>Get rid of wallboard, paneling and plaster to a minimum of the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when damp. It can be a long-term health hazard and should be gotten rid of if soaked by infected floodwater. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This develops a "chimney effect" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but utilize only the idea of the blade and keep an eye out for pipes, ductwork and circuitry.<p>
<p>If you believe mold growth in your attic  or crawl area, it is very important to be proactive. In time, mold left unchecked will continue to grow as spores reproduce and eventually spread, developing a larger, more pricey mold remediation task for professionals in the future.
