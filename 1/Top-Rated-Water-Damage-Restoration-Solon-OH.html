<p>When water freezes, it expands, which can be an issue for your home. Frozen water can cause pipes to burst, resulting in expensive and messy repair. Thankfully, there are steps you can take to prevent a water disaster. As the temperature level drops, keep a stable drip of water going to help avoid freezing. Pay special attention to pipelines in basements, garages, the back of cabinets, and other places that may not be getting the very same amount of heat as other locations in your home. Covering them in a layer of insulation can go a long way in avoiding a burst.</p>
