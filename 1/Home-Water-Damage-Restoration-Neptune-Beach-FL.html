<p>When left alone, mold can cause severe health issues through airborne pathogens. What you may not know is that a lot of chemicals, including bleach, have actually been shown inefficient versus removing mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it in fact facilitates mold growth.
