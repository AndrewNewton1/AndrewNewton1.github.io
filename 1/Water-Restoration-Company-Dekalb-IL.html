<p>We called them out to evaluate water damage in our kitchen area after we found our faucet was dripping. They were quick to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They established a makeshift kitchen for us in our living room and hauled away whatever else.  We were extremely delighted that we didn't have to lift a finger.  When they came back the next service day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were extremely expert and hardworking.  I could not think they got a lot done in one day!  Somebody has come out every day to check in and I feel confident in their knowledge and capabilities to get the job done appropriately. I would recommend them in a heart beat.<p>
<p>Use a fabric or paper towel to dab your phone dry. Do not rub the phone dry, because it could mistakenly push liquid into the phone's more sensitive parts. You may try vacuuming around the phone's openings and cracks to suck more water out if the phone was totally submerged. As soon as the mold is gone, the task isn't over yet. Correct cleanup after mold removal is necessary to prevent recontamination. You must seal and right away dispose of materials that might have contact with mold, like your mask. Rinse off the boots or shoes you wore while cleaning, clean your clothes in hot water, and shower to wash away spores that may have be on your hair or skin.<p>
