<p>Centrifugal Fans: Centrifugal fans are great for drying in hard to reach locations-- under sinks, baseboards, toe-kicks-- and are preferable when drying under carpet and cushioning. Much like axial fans, centrifugal fans move air throughout damp surfaces, evaporating wetness into the air. With making use of warm air from the centrifugal, the water vapor is taken in by the dehumidifier. In addition to axial fans, an enough number of centrifugal fans are chosen.</p>
<p>Once standing water is removed, the goal or our drying equipment is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in locations where water has actually absorbed (this will temporarily increase the humidity in the affected spaces) and b) remove the wetness in the air with powerful dehumidifiers. There might be times when the rate of evaporation is somewhat out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our monitoring procedure includes checking ambient conditions both inside and out, and if we can benefit from low humidity outdoors, we may elect to open a window or door to temporarily purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly based on temperature level also, so cooling a room down with outdoor air can also set a drying job back days. We ask that you please inquire with our service technicians before you make any changes if you have questions on this.</p>
