The perpetrator might have been something as simple as a pressure relief valve needing changing or something disastrous like a tank failure.</p>
<p>To keep indoor surfaces as dry as possible, attempt to preserve the home's relative humidity in between 20-40 percent in the Winter season and less than 60 percent the remainder of the year.
