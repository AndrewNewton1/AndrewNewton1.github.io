<p>Current Review: We called them out to examine water damage in our kitchen area after we discovered our faucet was leaking. They fasted to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They established a makeshift cooking area for us in our living room and carried away everything else.  We were very delighted that we didn't have to lift a finger.  When they returned the next business day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were extremely expert and hardworking.  I couldn't think they got a lot done in one day!  Somebody has actually come out each day to check in and I feel confident in their understanding and capabilities to finish the job properly. I would suggest them in a heart beat.<p>
