<p>Water intrusion into structures can be extremely damaging. As soon as InstaScope was created, we engaged a team of researchers at the University of Colorado.

Together, we had the ability to develop a brand-new mold-assessment system for commercial clients that, unlike any other method or gadget, can deliver clinically precise, area-by-area outcomes-- and do so immediately.
