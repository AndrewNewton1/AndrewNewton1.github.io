<p>Water intrusion into structures can be extremely damaging. As soon as InstaScope was created, we engaged a team of researchers at the University of Colorado.

Together, we had the ability to develop a brand-new mold-assessment system for commercial clients that, unlike any other method or gadget, can deliver clinically precise, area-by-area outcomes-- and do so immediately. So when you think about all the risks of mold, InstaScope is an important tool to help ensure the health of your home and the health of your household.</p>
