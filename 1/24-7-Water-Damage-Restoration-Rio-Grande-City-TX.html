<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also known as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they end up being water-damaged or wet. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some stress of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other elements. When mycotoxins exist, they occur in both living and dead mold spores, and may be present in products that have actually ended up being polluted with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from ending up being airborne. When the mold dries and passes away up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to end up being airborne.</p>
