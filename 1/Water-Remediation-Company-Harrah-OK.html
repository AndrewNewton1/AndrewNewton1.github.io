<h3>Smoke Damage Removal in Harrah</h3>

To clean mold utilizing borax, mix the powder in one gallon of hot water. Use the solution on the surface affected by mold and scrub the location with a carpet or brush until the mold disappears. There's no requirement to rinse it off since borax will keep the mold from coming back. However, do not use this cleaner on porous surface areas like drywall. Such products absorb water quickly.
