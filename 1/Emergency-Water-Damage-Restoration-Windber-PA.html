Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at very first as his schedule was currently full, however when he found out just how much water bill I was paying since the leak began, he consented to help me out on a Sunday early morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 remain in his complete uniform and all the equipment. He found & marked the location of the leakage for me and then even helped me closed down my main water valve.
