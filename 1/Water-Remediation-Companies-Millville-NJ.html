<p>As the job progresses and the environment is stabilized, products can be dried by handling the air flow, humidity, and energy (heat). Further into the drying, air motion should be re-directed and ensure excellent transfer of energy to the remaining damp locations.

Utilizing bleach on noticeable mold growth is NOT recommended by either the EPA or the CDC and is not part of the ANSI-IICRC S520 Standard for Professional Mold Remediation.
