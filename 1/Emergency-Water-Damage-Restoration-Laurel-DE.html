Permeable products like ceiling tiles, insulation drywall and fabric are generally removed. Semi-Porous non-Removable products like wood and concrete can be cleaned with HEPA vacuum, abrasive sanding and hand cleaning. Our service technicians will then pressure clean all impacted semi-porous and non-porous building products, such as cement, tile, and wood. Then, they will apply bactericide in order to reduce the effects of germs and other impurities. Finally, professionals will force-dry the area utilizing industrial structural drying equipment.<p>
