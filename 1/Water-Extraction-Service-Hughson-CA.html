<p>Because common structure products are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are common, mold growth in an indoor environment is generally associated with water or wetness direct exposure and may be brought on by insufficient drying of floor covering products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes issues can cause interior mold development. Water vapor typically condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to grow. 8 This moisture vapor goes through walls and ceilings, normally condensing throughout the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" finds wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
