<h3>From Fire Water Restoration to Mold Removal in Sandpoint</h3>
<p>Get rid of paneling, plaster and wallboard to a minimum of the flood level. When damp, Wallboard acts like a sponge. If soaked by contaminated floodwater, it can be a long-term health hazard and must be eliminated. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This develops a "chimney effect" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however utilize just the tip of the blade and keep an eye out for pipes, ductwork and wiring.<p>
