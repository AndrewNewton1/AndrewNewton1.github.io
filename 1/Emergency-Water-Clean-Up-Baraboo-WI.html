<p>Remove the device from the water as quickly as possible, and get rid of the battery right away. Removing the battery rapidly could make the distinction to save your phone. A lot of phones have a white sign near the battery that will turn pink or red if water has damaged the device. You can try to draw the moisture out by immersing the phone in a bowl of rice or other absorbent material overnight. You can also attempt to dry it out with a vacuum, as long as you do not hold the vacuum too near the device. In some cases cleaning the phone with rubbing alcohol will work if it has actually not been exposed to water very long.</p>
