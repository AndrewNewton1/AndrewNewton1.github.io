Some of the mold on the surface area might be eliminated but the roots of the mold are left undamaged meaning the mold soon returns, leaving you in a cycle of repeated bleaching. Perhaps this is why some people believe that spraying bleach on mold doesn't affect it but instead just bleaches its color so you can no longer see it.<p>
