<p>Due to the fact that typical building products can sustaining mold growth and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold development in an indoor environment is typically related to water or wetness exposure and may be caused by insufficient drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes issues can lead to interior mold development. Water vapor frequently condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to flourish. 8 This wetness vapor travels through ceilings and walls, normally condensing throughout the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" detects wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
