<p>Experiencing a disaster that requires fire damage cleanup in your home or organisation is one of the most terrible things that can happen to a household or a person. Depending upon the damage the hardwood floor might be repaired rather than being fully replaced. Then the bulk of the floor can be conserved and an isolated floorboard might need fixing, if there is small damage. However, if the damage is significant then the whole floor may need replacing and often even the subfloor too. The type of wood floor covering you might have limits the type and figures out of repairs that need to happen. Solid hardwood flooring permits a broader variety of choices to repair the issue. With strong hardwood floorings, you can sand and scrape away as much as a quarter of an inch off the wood to eliminate water damage on the surface area. This kind of floor covering can also have replacements for specific planks. The best method to look after a water damaged area on your wood floor is to change the affected boards and after that refinish the entire floor to bring it back to a unifying look.</p>
