<p>Water Damage Restoration Seattle WA. Step the height and width of the space you're repairing so that you know how much new wallboard you need. If you require custom-sized panels for an irregularly shaped repair, utilize your measurements to cut a patch to fit, utilizing an utility knife or drywall saw. Align your new panel with the wall studs and then protect the panel to the studs with drywall screws and a power driver. Use joint tape to cover the seams where each panel meets. Then use joint substance over the tape, using a putty knife. Let the substance dry for the time defined by the maker and after that sand the substance with fine-grit sandpaper till the joints are flush with the drywall panels.</p>
