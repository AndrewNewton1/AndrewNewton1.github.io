Disintegration to concrete and brick within a home is possible due to prolonged water direct exposure and needs masonry work to repair. Long-term staining on walls and floorings is another possible effect of water damage. Walls and floor covering may need replacement or refinishing depending upon the degree of damage. Moldy odors can linger in a home where leakages or flooding have occurred and this could be a sign of excess mold and mildew development.</p>
