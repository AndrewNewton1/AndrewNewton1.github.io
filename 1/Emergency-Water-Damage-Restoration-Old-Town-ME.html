<p>Deterioration is a process, which transforms refined metals to their more steady oxide. It is the progressive and slow deterioration of materials (typically metals) by chemical reaction within their environment, In this case the deterioration takes place when you integrate electricity, metal, oxygen and water, developing iron oxide (or what is more typically referred to as rust). There is no trusted timetable for this process to take place; a MacBook's internal components typically begin wearing away immediately after the spill, however in some cases your Mac can work normally for days or weeks without showing any obvious sign of an issue. How quick the corrosion procedure takes depends upon a lots of factors we have no control over, like humidity, the seriousness of the spill, and for how long the device stayed in contact with the liquid. The best practice is to not power on or use the MacBook at all up until you can resolve the damage. Below are a couple of examples of rust caused by a water spill.</p>
