<p>Since common building products are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold development in an indoor environment is normally connected to water or wetness direct exposure and may be brought on by insufficient drying of flooring materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes issues can lead to interior mold growth. Water vapor typically condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to flourish. 8 This wetness vapor passes through walls and ceilings, typically condensing during the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" finds wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as polished concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
