<p>Current Evaluation: We called them out to examine water damage in our cooking area after we discovered our faucet was dripping. They were quick to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They established a makeshift kitchen area for us in our living-room and hauled away whatever else.  We were really pleased that we didn't need to raise a finger.  When they returned the next business day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were really expert and hardworking.  I could not believe they got so much carried out in one day!  Somebody has come out every day to check in and I feel confident in their knowledge and abilities to finish the job correctly. I would advise them in a heart beat.<p>
