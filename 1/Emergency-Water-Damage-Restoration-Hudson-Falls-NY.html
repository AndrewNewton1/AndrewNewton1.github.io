Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at first as his schedule was currently full, however when he discovered how much water costs I was paying since the leak started, he agreed to assist me out on a Sunday early morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his complete uniform and all the devices. He marked the place & found of the leakage for me and after that even helped me shut down my main water valve. Easy-going and very polite individual.<p>
