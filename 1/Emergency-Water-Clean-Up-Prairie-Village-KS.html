What you may not know is that many chemicals, including bleach, have actually been proven inadequate against eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it actually assists in mold development. The chlorine particles stay on the surface and will only kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>
