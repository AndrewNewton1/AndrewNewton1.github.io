<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call a professional rapidly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. Did you know that smoke is actually made of small particles of the fire itself? It's a toxic, hot substance that can damage the surfaces it touches, simply as fire does. Many individuals believe that due to the fact that smoke rises into the air, diffusion occurs, and it just goes away. While diffusion-- the spread of a compound from high concentration to lower concentration-- does occur, this implies that the smoke will spread, harming a much wider location than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is allowed to exist, the more extensive the smoke damage will be. The best smoke damage restoration techniques will include searching a wide location to clean up and repair smoke damage.</p>
