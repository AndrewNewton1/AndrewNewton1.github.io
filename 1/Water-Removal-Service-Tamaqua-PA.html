<p>Water invasion into structures can be exceptionally damaging. Jake and his men were incredible in helping us get through flooding from Typhoon Florence. They were quick to get to the house and began drying out our soaked crawlspace right away. They came back every day (frequently twice a day) to monitor and adjust the dehumidifiers and fans to take full advantage of the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They discussed whatever they were doing along the way and likewise were extremely handy in collaborating efforts with the insurance adjuster. They were more than fair on the expenses and I 'd recommend them without hesitation.</p>

<p>You can never totally get rid of mold from your house; a small number of mold spores will constantly exist indoors and are a natural and handy  part of our world. However, if water or moisture is left unattended inside your home and mold begins to colonize, it can present a major health threat. Mold remediation can rapidly and safely remove a mold invasion from your home or office. Depending upon the size of your issue, mold remediation may take anywhere from one to seven days (or more) to wipe out the significant sources of mold in your home.</p>
<p>Be sure to keep photos of the water damage and all files connected with the damage and your claim in case mold grows in the future. Your insurance provider may be reluctant to concur that any potential mold is the outcome of prior water damage, however having photos and records will serve as valuable evidence of your claim. If the mold is considered to have come from water damage, some insurance providers may make you file a second claim of water damage instead, needing you to pay another deductible before remediation occurs.</p>
