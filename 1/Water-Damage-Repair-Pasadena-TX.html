<h3>Tips To Restoration And Clean-Up After Smoke And Fire Damage in Pasadena</h3>
<p>When you are planning big repair work, bear in mind that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the remainder of the sheet. By reducing the thickness here, it's easier to conceal long taped seams under numerous coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the remainder of the sheet. In order to get an even, finished appearance, it is very important to prevent joining bound edges to butt edges. Likewise keep in mind that considering that wall studs are vertical, drywall is usually attached so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This helps strengthen the strength of the wall and helps separate vertical seams in the drywall that tend to be more obvious even when the job is ended up.<p>
