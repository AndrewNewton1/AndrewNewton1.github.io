<p>One day, I came home from work thinking I 'd be able to unwind. Rather, I came inside to rain putting down from the kitchen ceiling due to the fact that my kid left on the bathroom faucet throughout the day (9+ hours).

Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at very first as his schedule was already complete, but when he learnt just how much water costs I was paying given that the leakage began, he accepted help me out on a Sunday morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his complete uniform and all the devices. He marked the area & found of the leakage for me and after that even assisted me shut down my primary water valve. Really courteous and easy-going person.</p>
