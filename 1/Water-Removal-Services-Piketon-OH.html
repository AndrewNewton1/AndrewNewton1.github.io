If there is a source of power readily available, such as a battery, which is providing power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electrical current will engage with the liquid and accelerate this rust procedure. This causes the copper and other metals to migrate throughout the board. You will likely end up with a very expensive paperweight if this corrosion procedure is not stopped.</p>
