<p>An inspector must supply you with a report that includes lab outcomes of air and surface area samples taken. They need to tell you this or be able to tell you whether you require a mold remediation specialist if the problem can be resolved DIY.

Ultimately, the mold will damage the products it is growing on and might trigger health effects for occupants.<p>
