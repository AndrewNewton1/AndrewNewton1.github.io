<p>An inspector must supply you with a report that includes lab outcomes of air and surface area samples taken. They need to tell you this or be able to tell you whether you require a mold remediation specialist if the problem can be resolved DIY. Mold can start to grow on interior structure surfaces and home furnishings if there is too much wetness. Ultimately, the mold will damage the products it is growing on and might trigger health effects for occupants.<p>
