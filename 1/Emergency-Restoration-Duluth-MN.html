<p>Mold (American English) or mould (British English), also sometimes described as mildew, is a fungal development that establishes on damp materials. Mold is a natural part of the environment and plays a vital part in nature by breaking down dead organic matter such as fallen leaves and dead trees; inside your home, mold growth should be prevented. Mold reproduce by methods of tiny spores. The spores are like seeds, however invisible to the naked eye, that float through the air and deposit on surface areas. When the temperature level, wetness, and available nutrient conditions are right, the spores can form into new mold colonies where they are deposited. 1 There are numerous kinds of mold, but all need moisture and a food source for development.</p>
