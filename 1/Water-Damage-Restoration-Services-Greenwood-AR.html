<p>For the victims caught up in or affected by a fire, whether in the house or work, it can be one of the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Look for visible mold development (it might look cottony, creamy, rough, or leatherlike and have various colors like white, gray, brown, black, yellow, or green).
