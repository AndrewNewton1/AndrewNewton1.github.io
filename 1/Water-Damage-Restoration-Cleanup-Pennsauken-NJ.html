<p>Fire Damage is the most disastrous sort of property damage that a household or organisation can experience. When MacBook water damage has happened, the liquid will likely make its way to the logic board and other parts.

This triggers the copper and other metals to move across the board. You will likely end up with a really costly paperweight if this rust procedure is not stopped.</p>
