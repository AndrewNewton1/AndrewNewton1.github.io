<p>Recent Review: I needed an emergency water leak detection work done as water was gushing somewhere unknown and water meter was jumping up like crazy (I got a costs for $370, and the public utility told me if it's addressing the current rate, my next expense will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at first as his schedule was currently complete, but when he learnt just how much water bill I was paying since the leak started, he accepted help me out on a Sunday early morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 remain in his full uniform and all the equipment. He marked the location & found of the leakage for me and then even helped me closed down my primary water valve. Easy-going and really polite person.</p>
