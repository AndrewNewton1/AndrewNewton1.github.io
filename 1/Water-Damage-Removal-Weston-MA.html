<p>Another downside of bleach is that it can damage the materials it's used on as it is an extreme, corrosive chemical. When blended with ammonia, chlorine bleach also gives off harsh fumes and it even produces poisonous gas.

For these reasons try to avoid using bleach and if you must use it, only use it on non-porous surface areas.</p>
