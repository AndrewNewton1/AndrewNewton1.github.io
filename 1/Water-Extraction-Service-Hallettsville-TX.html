If soaked by polluted floodwater, it can be an irreversible health hazard and must be removed.

This creates a "chimney impact" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however utilize only the pointer of the blade and watch out for pipelines, ductwork and circuitry.<p>
