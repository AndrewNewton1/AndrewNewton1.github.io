Once MacBook water damage has actually taken place, the liquid will likely make its way to the reasoning board and other components. The liquid's minerals and salts instantly begin to eat away at the metal, silicone and fiberglass components. Frequently, the Mac will work for a few days after the spill and after that quit working. This is because of the metals oxidizing and slowly rusting. If there is a power source available, such as a battery, which is supplying power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electrical current will engage with the liquid and accelerate this deterioration process. This triggers the copper and other metals to move across the board. You will likely end up with a really expensive paperweight if this rust process is not stopped.</p>
