An automated shut-off valve is outstanding insurance to have in any situation, particularly when the hot water heater unit lies inside the home. Damage from water dripping out of your water heater impends unless repaired rapidly, and the expenses go up the longer the issue goes uncorrected. The perpetrator may have been something as simple as a pressure relief valve requiring replacing or something devastating like a tank failure.</p>
<p>Class 4 - deeply held or bound water. Water invasion that involves a substantial amount of water absorption into low evaporation materials (e.g., plaster, wood, concrete, masonry) or low evaporation assemblies (e.g., multilayer wallboard, multilayer subfloors, gym floorings, or other complex, developed assemblies). Drying may need special techniques, longer drying times, or significant water vapor pressure differentials.</p>
