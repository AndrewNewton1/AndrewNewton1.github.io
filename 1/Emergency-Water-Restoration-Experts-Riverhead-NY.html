<p>Cleanup: During the cleaning and restoration phase of the task, your qualified cleanup group will utilize the proper combination of cleaning agents, air cleaning gadgets, and deodorizers. Using chem-sponges is crucial in this stage. A chem-sponge collects soot and particles when it comes into contact with them. It also avoids spotting on walls and surface areas. Walls and ceilings that need to be cleaned are first cleaned with a dry chem-sponge, then with a degreaser and deodorizing agent. These numerous actions are needed to guarantee walls and ceilings are clean and that residual smell has actually been eliminated.</p>
