<p>The location that is being treated is sealed, as mold spores can quickly travel once they are disturbed. Air purification systems are generally used in combination with the sealing of the location to remove as lots of air-borne spores as possible and to prevent spread. Sealing the location involves the use of both physical barriers, such as plastic sheeting, along with unfavorable atmospheric pressure, which prevents the flow of air in between the contaminated area and the areas around it. All heating, cooling, and fans in the location will be switched off to avoid the mold from spreading as well.</p>
<p>To ensure you are totally eliminating mold in your house, a personalized mold assessment and mold cleanup procedure will be followed to effectively get rid of and deal with the contaminated locations. Mold testing alternatives include air-cell tests and swab samples to recognize the types and concentrations of mold present in an environment. As soon as the source and types of mold are identified, a mold removal strategy will be established and carried out, consisting of containment of the work area to control and limit the spread of mold in your home or other impurities into surrounding locations of the home.</p>
