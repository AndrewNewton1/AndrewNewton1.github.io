<p>When left alone, mold can trigger serious health issues through airborne pathogens. What you may not understand is that a lot of chemicals, including bleach, have been proven inefficient versus removing mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it actually facilitates mold growth. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface area and will just kill a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>To eliminate mold in the basement, scrub the walls utilizing a large brush, and keep in mind that permeable surface areas such as ceiling tiles or drywall may need to be removed and changed. If basement carpet has ended up being moldy, sweep it (while using a mask) to loosen up the mold and let it dry in the sun if you can move it, or use high-powered fans to eliminate moisture if it's affixed to the floor.</p>
