<p>Places that are typically or constantly damp can be difficult to keep entirely free of mold. If there's some mold in the shower or elsewhere in the bathroom that appears to reappear, increasing ventilation (running a fan or opening a window) and cleaning more often will typically prevent mold from recurring, or at least keep the mold to a minimum. We can provide you with extra services if you need them in addition to your restoration work, including pipes, basic contracting, electrical, and cooling and heating.<p>
