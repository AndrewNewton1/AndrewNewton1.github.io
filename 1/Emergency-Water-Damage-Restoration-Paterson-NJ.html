However, if the damage is major then the whole floor might need changing and sometimes even the subfloor also. The sort of wood floor covering you might have identifies and restricts the type of repairs that need to happen. Strong hardwood floor covering enables a wider range of alternatives to repair the problem. With strong hardwood floors, you can sand and scrape away as much as a quarter of an inch off the wood to eliminate water damage on the surface.

The best method to take care of a water damaged location on your wood floor is to replace the afflicted boards and then refinish the whole floor to bring it back to a unifying look.</p>

<p>Recent Review: I required an emergency water leakage detection work done as water was gushing somewhere unknown and water meter was jumping up like crazy (I got an expense for $370, and the water company told me if it's going at the existing rate, my next costs will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at very first as his schedule was already complete, however when he discovered how much water expense I was paying considering that the leakage started, he accepted help me out on a Sunday morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his complete uniform and all the devices. He found & marked the area of the leakage for me and after that even assisted me shut down my main water valve. Easy-going and very courteous individual.</p>
