Depending on the damage the hardwood floor may be repaired rather than being fully changed. Then the majority of the floor can be saved and a separated floorboard may require repairing, if there is small damage. However, if the damage is major then the entire floor might require replacing and often even the subfloor too. The type of wood floor covering you may have figures out and limits the type of repair work that require to take place.
