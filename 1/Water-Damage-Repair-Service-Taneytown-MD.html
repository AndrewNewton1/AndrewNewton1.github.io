<h3>Fire Damage Contractors in Taneytown</h3>
<p>Keep in mind that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet when you are planning large repair work. By decreasing the density here, it's much easier to conceal long taped seams under a number of coats of joint substance. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet. In order to get an even, completed look, it is very important to prevent signing up with bound edges to butt edges. Also keep in mind that given that wall studs are vertical, drywall is usually attached so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This helps enhance the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical seams in the drywall that tend to be more visible even when the job is finished.<p>
