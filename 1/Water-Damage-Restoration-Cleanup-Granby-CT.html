<p>Air Cleaning: Instantly we equip the property with air scrubbers. We often will set one system for each 2 to 3 spaces, depending upon the size of the space. These systems have a consumption and outtake. The existing air is sucked through the consumption where it travels through three filters, one of which is a HEPA filter. These filters are evaluated and accredited to 99.99% HEPA effectiveness, which indicates that they get rid of at least 99.99% of particles as little 0.3 microns in size. The air that is launched through the outtake has actually been cleaned up and much of the odor got rid of. This procedure goes on for days. As you can imagine, over the course of numerous days, the air that can be found in through the intake is cleaner and cleaner with less odor so, with time and effective air scrubbing, we begin the air cleaning and ventilating procedures.</p>
