<p>Mold can trigger severe health concerns through air-borne pathogens when left alone. Juice 3 to 5 lemons and pour over afflicted location. Let it sit for 5 minutes, and after that clean it away with a damp towel. Similar to a few of the above techniques, you can use a toothbrush to scrub at the problem zone if you seem like the towel isn't working well enough. For optimal cleaning, mix lemon juice with any dish or hand soap you have in your home plus a little water. The soap will add a little extra heft to the mold-removal process.</p>
