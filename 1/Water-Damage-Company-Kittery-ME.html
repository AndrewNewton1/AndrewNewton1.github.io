<p>When left alone, mold can trigger major health issues through air-borne pathogens. What you might not understand is that a lot of chemicals, including bleach, have been shown inefficient versus eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a permeable surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it actually helps with mold growth. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface and will only kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>
