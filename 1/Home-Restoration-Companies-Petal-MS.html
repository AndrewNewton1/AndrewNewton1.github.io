<p>Deterioration is a process, which converts refined metals to their more stable oxide. It is the sluggish and progressive wear and tear of materials (usually metals) by chain reaction within their environment, In this case the corrosion occurs when you combine electrical power, metal, oxygen and water, producing iron oxide (or what is more commonly known as rust). There is no reliable schedule for this procedure to occur; a MacBook's internal parts normally begin rusting right away after the spill, however in many cases your Mac can work typically for days or weeks without revealing any obvious indication of a problem. How quick the deterioration process takes depends upon a ton of aspects we have no control over, like humidity, the severity of the spill, and for how long the device stayed in contact with the liquid. The very best practice is to not power on or use the MacBook at all up until you can address the damage. Below are a couple of examples of corrosion brought on by a water spill.</p>
