<p>The most crucial aspect of correcting drywall water damage is to prevent extra damage from mold or mildew. Mold and mildew take place most frequently when moist drywall sits with insufficient ventilation. No matter the area or level of the damage, we recommend using dehumidifiers, commercial fans, or comparable makers that can move a big volume of air for maximum ventilation. Basic household fans are not efficient in moving a sufficient quantity of air required to dry a space adequately.</p>

Condensation in the area between the attic and your home can trigger wetness on the underside of the roofing system, which can result in mold and rotting.
