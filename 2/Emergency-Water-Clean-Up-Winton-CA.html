<p>It's not simply a catch phrase! As a locally owned and operated organisation, we are prepared to respond quickly and expediently with the right tools and knowledge to get the job done QUICK. After a heavy rain storm, a quick reaction is CRITICAL to decreasing potential secondary damages and expenses to your Portland home or organisation.

<p>Tape over the seams with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape appears to be more convenient since it is self-adhesive, numerous professional drywall installers prefer paper tape. While I'm not an expert, I prefer paper tape, too. However, paper tape isn't always practical. Utilizing paper tape needs some practice and little skill, but it's well worth learning.
