The water penetrates through the flooring in to the subfloors, and it ultimately triggers the damage to the rooms located below.<p>
<p>Tape over the joints with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape seems to be more convenient due to the fact that it is self-adhesive, lots of professional drywall installers prefer paper tape.
