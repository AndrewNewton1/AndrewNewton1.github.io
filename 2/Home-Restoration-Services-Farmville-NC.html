<p>For the victims captured up in or impacted by a fire, whether at home or work, it can be one of the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Mold spores are like small seeds, drifting through the air up until they land somewhere. Think about planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with wetness and nutrients, then the seed will grow and sprout. Mold works the same way, so if the location the spores land is excellent and moist, mold can start to grow, spread, and make more mold spores. All it needs is time, and you can have a huge problem on your hands.</p>
<p>Stachybotrys chartarum: this mold is often described as black mold or poisonous mold because of the mycotoxins that it can produce.

In addition to being hazardous, black mold can also stain surface areas it grows on, which can make it harder to successfully eliminate. Frequently, surface areas with black mold might require additional whitening or replacement to handle the stains. In many cases, an encapsulating agent may be needed to cover the stain and any staying spores.</p>
