<h3>Fire Damage Restoration in Polk City - Restore Your Home and Your Life After Fire</h3>
<p>Remember that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet when you are planning big repairs. By reducing the thickness here, it's easier to hide long taped seams under several coats of joint substance. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet. In order to get an even, finished look, it is essential to prevent joining bound edges to butt edges. Likewise bear in mind that given that wall studs are vertical, drywall is normally attached so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This assists enhance the strength of the wall and assists separate vertical joints in the drywall that tend to be more noticeable even when the job is finished.<p>
