<p>When left alone, mold can trigger major health concerns through air-borne pathogens. What you may not understand is that a lot of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been shown ineffective versus eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it in fact facilitates mold growth. The chlorine particles remain on the surface area and will only eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>To keep indoor surface areas as dry as possible, try to keep the home's relative humidity in between 20-40 percent in the Winter season and less than 60 percent the remainder of the year. You can acquire gadgets to measure relative humidity at some home supply shops. Ventilation, air flow near cold surface areas, dehumidification, and efforts to decrease the production of wetness in the home are all very essential in controlling high humidity that regularly causes mold growth in our climate.</p>
