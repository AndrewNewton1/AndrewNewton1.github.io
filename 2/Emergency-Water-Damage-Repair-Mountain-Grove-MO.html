Utilizing bleach on visible mold development is NOT suggested by either the EPA or the CDC and is not part of the ANSI-IICRC S520 Standard for Expert Mold Remediation. Initially, bleach is a chemical and can affect people with chemical level of sensitivities specifically if used in locations that are not well ventilated.
