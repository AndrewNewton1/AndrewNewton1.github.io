It was an extreme experience, but everything they did for me was excellent. They best feature of First Reaction was that they were able to manage my insurance company when they were providing me problems. This probably helped me out the most. Brent, the owner, stepped right in and handled the problem for me, which was a huge relief. They were very expert, and I liked everyone I dealt with from the company. They covered all the bases, and the repair work were managed to my satisfaction. I would use them again.<p>
