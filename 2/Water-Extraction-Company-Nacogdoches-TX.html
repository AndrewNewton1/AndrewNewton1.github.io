<p>While the iPhone 7 and later on are waterproof, it does not stop water from entering into the speaker grille. The Apple Watch Series 2 and later have a similar issue, although they feature an integrated function that can be toggled to 'eject' the water by playing a particular frequency. The worst problem with mold is that it has the potential to trigger health results. Mold can activate allergic reactions and even asthma attacks, as some individuals dislike mold. As mold requires water to grow it is very important to avoid moisture and humidity problems in buildings, especially ones affected by water.<p>
