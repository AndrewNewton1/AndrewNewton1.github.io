<p>Mold can cause severe health issues through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you may not understand is that most chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been proven inadequate versus eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it really helps with mold growth. The chlorine particles remain on the surface and will just kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>Eliminate the device from the water as rapidly as possible, and get rid of the battery instantly. Eliminating the battery rapidly might make the distinction to conserve your phone. The majority of phones have a white sign near the battery that will turn pink or red if water has damaged the gadget. You can try to draw the moisture out by immersing the phone in a bowl of rice or other absorbent material overnight. You can also try to dry it out with a vacuum, as long as you do not hold the vacuum too near the gadget. In some cases cleaning the phone with rubbing alcohol will work if it has not been exposed to water very long.</p>
