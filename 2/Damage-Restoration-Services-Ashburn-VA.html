<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. Water damage, water intrusion, developing envelope problems, and building and construction problems are a very serious matter. Here in Portland, Oregon, Vancouver, Washington and the surrounding locations are experiencing many problems due to leaking doors and windows, water and wind driven rain damage. Senior living facilities, apartments, condominiums, townhouses, hotels, industrial structures are especially vulnerable to these concerns as usually the contractor subcontracts the exterior envelope work and wall assembly process, for that reason leading to corners and expenses being cut.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that common building products are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are common, mold growth in an indoor environment is generally connected to water or wetness direct exposure and may be brought on by incomplete drying of flooring materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can cause interior mold growth. Water vapor commonly condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to flourish. 8 This wetness vapor passes through walls and ceilings, typically condensing during the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" identifies wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as polished concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
