<p>Current Review: We called them out to examine water damage in our kitchen area after we discovered our faucet was leaking. They were quick to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift kitchen for us in our living-room and transported away everything else.  We were extremely delighted that we didn't need to raise a finger.  When they came back the next business day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were very professional and hardworking.  I couldn't believe they got so much performed in one day!  Someone has come out every day to sign in and I feel great in their understanding and abilities to get the job done properly. I would suggest them in a heart beat.<p>
<p>Do not pick the incorrect water damage restoration company. Call Damage Control today to restore your property to its previous condition. Do not wash walls.
