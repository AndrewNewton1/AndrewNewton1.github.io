<p>For the victims captured up in or impacted by a fire, whether in your home or work, it can be one of the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Mold spores are like small seeds, floating through the air up until they land someplace. Think of planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with wetness and nutrients, then the seed will sprout and grow. Mold works the very same method, so if the location the spores land is good and wet, mold can start to grow, spread, and make more mold spores. All it requires is time, and you can have a big issue on your hands.</p>
<p>A pipe burst in my crawlspace, triggering major water build-up. Colby and Caleb got here on the scene within a couple of hours and proceeded to drain pipes the area before any damage was done to my home. Colby returned the next day and installed brand-new insulation in the location. They provided exceptional, efficient, and professional service as well as being friendly and enjoyable to deal with. I completely recommend Affordable Restoration LLC and will call them once again should the requirement emerge.</p>
