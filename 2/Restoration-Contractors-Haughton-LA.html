<p>Tape over the joints with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape appears to be easier since it is self-adhesive, lots of professional drywall installers choose paper tape. While I'm not a professional, I prefer paper tape, too. Nevertheless, paper tape isn't constantly practical. Using paper tape requires some practice and little finesse, however it's well worth discovering. As soon as the meters check out moisture levels equal to the previous dry state of the room, the professional will get rid of the fans and dehumidifiers from the area. At this point, the water remediation procedure is considered to complete.<p>
<p>We called them out to evaluate water damage in our kitchen after we found our faucet was leaking. They fasted to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They established a makeshift cooking area for us in our living room and hauled away everything else.  We were extremely delighted that we didn't need to raise a finger.  When they came back the next organisation day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were very professional and hardworking.  I couldn't believe they got so much done in one day!  Somebody has actually come out each day to check in and I feel great in their understanding and abilities to finish the job correctly. I would advise them in a heart beat.<p>
