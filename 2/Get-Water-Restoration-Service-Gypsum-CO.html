<p>Fire is the outcome of a chain reaction between the oxygen that is present in the atmosphere and a source of flammable fuel. As soon as this flammable fuel - furniture, drywall, or carpet - has been heated up to its distinct ignition temperature, the fuel will catch fire and unstable gases will be released in the form of smoke. While smoke and the residue it leaves behind can cause enduring damage and ought to be dealt with by experienced experts, heat is the most obvious, and damaging, item of this chain reaction. What's more, fire is self-perpetuating - implying that as a fire comes into contact with extra fuel, the response continues and the fire spreads.</p>
<p>Air Cleaning: Instantly we gear up the home with air scrubbers. We typically will set one system for every two to three spaces, depending upon the size of the space. These systems have a consumption and outtake. The existing air is drawn through the intake where it goes through 3 filters, one of which is a HEPA filter. These filters are evaluated and licensed to 99.99% HEPA efficiency, which indicates that they eliminate at least 99.99% of particles as small 0.3 microns in size. The air that is released through the outtake has been cleaned and much of the smell removed. This process goes on for days. As you can picture, throughout numerous days, the air that can be found in through the intake is cleaner and cleaner with less odor so, with time and efficient air scrubbing, we start the air cleaning and deodorizing treatments.</p>
