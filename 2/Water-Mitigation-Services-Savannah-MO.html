<h3>Tips to Recover From Fires Caused by Flooding in Savannah</h3>
<p>Get rid of wallboard, paneling and plaster to a minimum of the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when damp. It can be a long-term health threat and must be removed if soaked by polluted floodwater. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This creates a "chimney impact" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however use only the pointer of the blade and keep an eye out for pipes, ductwork and wiring.<p>
<p>Deodorization: In concerns to deodorization, we use either ozone machines, which can only be used when the home is completely vacant for an extended time, or hydroxyl systems. Throughout the years, we have actually utilized hydroxyl units increasingly more on our fire and smoke tasks. These units can be used while work is being finished with no damage to professionals or locals. We set these systems up on day one and permit them to run for the whole project. Typically, the unit will be set closest to the reason for the fire to be most reliable.<p>
