Black mold can be hazardous to your health, primarily causing breathing issues. However in extreme cases and for individuals with pre-existing health conditions, black mold can lead to pneumonia. When you believe a mold invasion, you may want to purchase a mold testing package to see what kind of mold spores you're working with, and employ an expert to help with removal.

We can check and assess your home and utilize our specialized expertise, devices, and training to remediate your mold infestation if your home or organisation has a mold problem.</p>
