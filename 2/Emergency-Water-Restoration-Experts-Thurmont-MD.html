<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (likewise referred to as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become moist or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some strains of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other factors. When mycotoxins exist, they take place in both living and dead mold spores, and may be present in products that have actually become infected with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from becoming airborne. When the mold passes away and dries up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to end up being airborne.</p>

The total need for humidity control and airflow can be lower than at the start of the project considering that there is significantly less wetness in products being vaporized during the latter stage.</p>
<p>When standing water is removed, the goal or our drying equipment is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in locations where water has taken in (this will momentarily increase the humidity in the affected rooms) and b) eliminate the moisture in the air with effective dehumidifiers. There might be times when the rate of evaporation is somewhat out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our tracking process consists of examining ambient conditions both inside and out, and if we can take advantage of low humidity outdoors, we might choose to open a window or door to momentarily purge" the damp air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly dependent on temperature level as well, so cooling a room down with outside air can likewise set a drying project back days. If you have questions on this, we ask that you please inquire with our service professionals prior to you make any changes.</p>
