Surface area cleaning only removes noticeable contamination, however significant quantities of bacteria are typically left behind, which can possibly trigger health problems as well as unpleasant smells. All surface areas affected by water damage should be thoroughly cleaned up, sanitized and deodorized by experienced professionals in order to effectively remove disease-causing germs, fungis and other viruses prior to the area is safe for human beings once again.</p>
<p>In the course of a remediation, we sometimes recommend discarding specific types of surfaces and objects. Carpets, cabinets and drywall are all typical products in need of disposal.

Second, on non-porous surface areas such as tile, bleach is no more reliable at removing mold than a moist fabric and a moderate detergent, so we advise the least harmful alternative.</p>
