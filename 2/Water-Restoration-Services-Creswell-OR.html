<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (likewise referred to as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become water-damaged or damp. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some pressures of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other factors. When mycotoxins are present, they occur in both living and dead mold spores, and might exist in materials that have ended up being infected with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from becoming airborne. When the mold dries and passes away up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to become airborne.</p>
