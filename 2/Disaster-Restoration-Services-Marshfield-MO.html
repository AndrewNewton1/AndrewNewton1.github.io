The kind of wood floor covering you may have determines and limits the type of repair work that need to happen. Solid hardwood floor covering allows for a larger series of alternatives to repair the problem. With strong hardwood floors, you can sand and scrape away approximately a quarter of an inch off the wood to eliminate water damage on the surface. This type of floor covering can also have replacements for individual planks. The very best method to take care of a water damaged area on your wood floor is to change the afflicted boards and after that refinish the whole floor to bring it back to a unifying look.</p>
