Mold is more likely to be discovered in damp, dusty spaces or areas with stagnant air.<p>
<p>11. Drywall and other types of wall materials generally don't dry effectively, so if your walls are soaked, it's typically best to rip them out to prevent mold, particularly if they aren't totally dry within 48 hours.
