<p>Tape over the joints with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape appears to be more convenient due to the fact that it is self-adhesive, numerous professional drywall installers choose paper tape. While I'm not an expert, I prefer paper tape, too. Nevertheless, paper tape isn't constantly convenient. Using paper tape requires some practice and little finesse, but it's well worth finding out. When the meters read wetness levels equal to the previous dry state of the space, the professional will get rid of the fans and dehumidifiers from the area. At this point, the water remediation process is thought about to complete.<p>
