<p>Mold can cause serious health concerns through air-borne pathogens when left alone. Juice 3 to 5 lemons and pour over affected area. Let it sit for five minutes, and after that wipe it away with a damp towel. Similar to some of the above techniques, you can use a tooth brush to scrub at the issue zone if you seem like the towel isn't working well enough.
