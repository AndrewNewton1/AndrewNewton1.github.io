<p>When left alone, mold can cause severe health issues through airborne pathogens. What you might not know is that many chemicals, including bleach, have actually been proven inadequate against getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it really facilitates mold development. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface and will just kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>
