Air filtration systems are generally utilized in conjunction with the sealing of the area to eliminate as numerous air-borne spores as possible and to avoid spread. Sealing the location includes using both physical barriers, such as plastic sheeting, along with unfavorable air pressure, which prevents the circulation of air in between the infected space and the locations around it. All heating, cooling, and fans in the location will be turned off to prevent the mold from spreading out as well.</p>
