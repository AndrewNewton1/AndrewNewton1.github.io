Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at first as his schedule was currently complete, however when he found out just how much water costs I was paying because the leakage began, he consented to help me out on a Sunday early morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 remain in his complete uniform and all the equipment. He found & marked the area of the leak for me and then even helped me shut down my main water valve. Easy-going and extremely respectful person.</p>
