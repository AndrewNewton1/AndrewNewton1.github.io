<h3>Cleaning Fire Damage in West Palm Beach</h3>
<p>Remove wallboard, paneling and plaster to a minimum of the flood level. Wallboard imitates a sponge when damp. It can be an irreversible health risk and need to be removed if soaked by infected floodwater. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This develops a "chimney effect" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however utilize just the suggestion of the blade and keep an eye out for pipelines, ductwork and wiring.<p>
