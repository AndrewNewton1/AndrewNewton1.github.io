Flooding, leaking roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes issues can lead to interior mold growth. Water vapor frequently condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to grow. 8 This wetness vapor goes through walls and ceilings, usually condensing during the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone.
