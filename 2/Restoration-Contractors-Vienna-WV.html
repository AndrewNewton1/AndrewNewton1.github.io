This can result from any variety of situations such as flooding, water accumulation after a fire, a damaged pipe, or perhaps a malfunctioning HEATING AND COOLING system - all of which can result in difficulty. Any high degree of moisture, combined with temperature and nutrients, produces the perfect environment for the fungal elements of mold and mildew to grow. It is very important to remove the source of the wetness to prevent the spread of mold contamination as quickly as possible.</p>
