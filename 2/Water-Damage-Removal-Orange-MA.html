<p>For the victims caught up in or affected by a fire, whether in your home or work, it can be among the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Mold spores are like tiny seeds, drifting through the air up until they land someplace. Consider planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with wetness and nutrients, then the seed will sprout and grow. Mold works the same way, so if the place the spores land is excellent and moist, mold can start to grow, spread, and make more mold spores. All it needs is time, and you can have a huge problem on your hands.</p>
<p>Another disadvantage of bleach is that it can damage the materials it's used on as it is an extreme, destructive chemical.

There are more secure alternatives such as borax or vinegar which don't produce harmful fumes or leave harmful residue. For these factors attempt to prevent utilizing bleach and if you must utilize it, just utilize it on non-porous surface areas.</p>
