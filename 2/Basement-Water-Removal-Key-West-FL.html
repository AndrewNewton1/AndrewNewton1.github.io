<p>Basements are very typical areas for mold to take hold and grow. They tend to get damp, that makes the ideal conditions for growing mold in corners and on walls and floorings.

There is no dependable timetable for this procedure to take place; a MacBook's internal elements generally start corroding right away after the spill, but sometimes your Mac can function usually for days or weeks without showing any obvious indication of a problem. How fast the rust process takes depends upon a ton of elements we have no control over, like humidity, the severity of the spill, and for how long the device remained in contact with the liquid. The best practice is to not power on or use the MacBook at all up until you can resolve the damage. Below are a couple of examples of deterioration brought on by a water spill.</p>
