<h2>Water Damage Repair and Restoration Tips in Dunn</h2>

<p>Experiencing a disaster that needs fire damage cleanup in your house or business is one of the most disastrous things that can happen to a family or a person. Depending on the damage the hardwood floor might be fixed instead of being completely replaced. Then the majority of the floor can be saved and a separated floorboard may need fixing, if there is small damage. Nevertheless, if the damage is significant then the entire floor might need changing and sometimes even the subfloor also. The kind of wood floor covering you might have determines and restricts the type of repairs that need to occur. Solid hardwood floor covering allows for a larger series of choices to repair the problem. With solid hardwood floors, you can sand and scrape away as much as a quarter of an inch off the wood to get rid of water damage on the surface area. This kind of flooring can also have replacements for specific planks. The best way to take care of a water damaged location on your wood floor is to change the afflicted boards and then refinish the whole floor to bring it back to a unifying look.</p>
