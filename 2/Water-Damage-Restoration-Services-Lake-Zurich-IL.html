<p>Don't presume your homeowners insurance coverage will pay to repair your mold problems. Insurance coverage generally pays if the problem results from an emergency currently covered on your policy, like a burst pipeline, but not if mold resulted from postponed maintenance, consistent moisture or seepage, or from floodwaters (unless you have flood insurance coverage). It's essential NOT to take a knee jerk reaction if you experience water damage. It's best to call your insurance provider instantly. Selecting the restoration company is totally decided by the home owner.<p>

After scrubbing thoroughly with the brush, clean the area clean with old rags or paper towels.<p>
