<p>Current Review: We called them out to evaluate water damage in our kitchen after we discovered our faucet was dripping. They were quick to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They established a makeshift kitchen area for us in our living room and carried away everything else.  We were really delighted that we didn't need to raise a finger.  When they came back the next organisation day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were really expert and hardworking.  I could not think they got a lot carried out in one day!  Somebody has come out every day to sign in and I feel confident in their knowledge and abilities to do the job correctly. I would recommend them in a heart beat.<p>
<p>For safety reasons, they also identify the kind of water they're handling prior to beginning the water restoration cleanup procedure. You might attempt powering your phone on at this point to evaluate the damage, however we recommend taking a further action prior to risking turning the phone on. Immerse your phone in a desiccant-- a compound that will induce dryness by taking in water. That's just an expensive way of saying, get the rice.<p>
<p>Water and bacteria-growth damages can start within hours. Call for professional aid.
