<p>Since typical building products can sustaining mold development and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold development in an indoor environment is normally related to water or wetness exposure and might be brought on by incomplete drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can lead to interior mold development. Water vapor typically condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to grow. 8 This moisture vapor passes through walls and ceilings, normally condensing throughout the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" detects wetness from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as refined concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
