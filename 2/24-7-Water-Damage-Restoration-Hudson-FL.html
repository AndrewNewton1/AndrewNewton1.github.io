<p>Any structure that has suffered from water damage or issues with excess moisture is at threat of mold growth. Disintegration to concrete and brick within a home is possible due to prolonged water direct exposure and requires masonry work to repair. Long-term staining on floorings and walls is another possible result of water damage. Walls and flooring might require replacement or refinishing depending on the degree of damage. Moldy smells can linger in a home where leaks or flooding have actually happened and this might be indicative of excess mold and mildew development.</p>
<p>An insurance coverage may or might not cover the expenses related to water damage and the process of water damage restoration.
