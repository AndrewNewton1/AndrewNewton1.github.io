They're smaller sized than basements, however, and usually have more ventilation, so they don't tend to have as large a mold growth area, making typical expenses better to $500 for remediation. Since of the size and ventilation, cleanup in this area is usually less extreme, so cleaning and eliminating affected areas is frequently adequate.</p>
