Black mold can be unsafe to your health, mainly causing respiratory concerns. But in extreme cases and for people with pre-existing health conditions, black mold can lead to pneumonia. When you believe a mold invasion, you may want to buy a mold screening kit to see what kind of mold spores you're working with, and hire a professional to aid with removal.
