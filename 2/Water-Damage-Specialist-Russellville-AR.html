<p>When left alone, mold can cause major health concerns through airborne pathogens. What you may not know is that the majority of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have been shown inadequate against getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a permeable surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it in fact facilitates mold development. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface and will just eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>
