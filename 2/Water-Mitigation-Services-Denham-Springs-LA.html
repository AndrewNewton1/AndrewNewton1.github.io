<p>For the victims caught up in or impacted by a fire, whether at home or work, it can be one of the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Mold spores are like small seeds, drifting through the air up until they land somewhere. Think of planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with wetness and nutrients, then the seed will grow and grow. Mold works the same way, so if the place the spores land is moist and great, mold can begin to grow, spread, and make more mold spores. All it requires is time, and you can have a big problem on your hands.</p>

<p>Flooding of a private sewer system can be a dangerous circumstance for homeowners, according to Pipes 2.0's veteran plumbing experts in Mesa, Arizona It may result in a back-up of sewage in the home, contaminated drinking water and absence of sanitation up until the system is fixed. When flooding or saturated soil conditions continue, a private sewer system can not operate effectively (typical pipes problems in old houses ). Soil treatment systems for wastewater depend on aerobic (with oxygen) areas to lower the amounts of chemicals and living organisms (infections, bacteria and protozoa). When the soil is saturated or flooded, those harmful products can go into the groundwater and your drinking supply of water.</p>
