Mold on the exterior of your home isn't simply unattractive - it can also ultimately migrate to the interior and cause more damage. A typical place where mold might appear on the outside of a home includes the decks, which can be cleaned up with detergent or other light cleaning service and a power washer. Clean vinyl or wood siding by power cleaning or scrubbing with a brush - hydrogen peroxide is a good service option, as it will not damage your landscaping For stucco or concrete walls, utilize a garden hose and sprayer attachment. Rinse the siding first, spray on non-toxic mold cleaner, enable it to sit while the mold starts to liquify, then wash it away.</p>
