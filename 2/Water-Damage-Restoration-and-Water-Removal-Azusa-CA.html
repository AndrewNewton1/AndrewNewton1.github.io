<p>When left alone, mold can trigger severe health concerns through air-borne pathogens. What you might not understand is that most chemicals, including bleach, have actually been proven inefficient versus getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it really assists in mold development. The chlorine particles stay on the surface area and will just kill a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>Even when you include a little indoor fire, smoke damage can take place. That's since fire is a visible combustion of light and heat, and many people understand how to contain a fire.

Also, since it's in the air, it's almost difficult to include. Even after a fire is offed, smoke in the air can trigger damage. Smoke damage restoration services are typically needed to bring back damage left from little indoor fires.</p>
