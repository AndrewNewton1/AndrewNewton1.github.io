<h3>Water & Fire Damage Restoration in Porterville</h3>
<p>A DIY mold remediation product that mold specialists generally suggest is borax - a white powder which you can buy from the grocery, at the detergent or laundry section. To clean mold using borax, blend the powder in one gallon of warm water. Apply the solution on the surface affected by mold and scrub the area with a rug or brush until the mold vanishes. Because borax will keep the mold from coming back, there's no need to wash it off. Nevertheless, do not utilize this cleaner on porous surfaces like drywall. Such materials absorb water easily. This could exacerbate the problem due to the fact that as you understand - mold enjoys wet environments.<p>
