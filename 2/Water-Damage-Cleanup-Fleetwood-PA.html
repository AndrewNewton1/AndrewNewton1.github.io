<p>Current Review: I required an emergency water leak detection work done as water was gushing someplace unidentified and water meter was leaping up like insane (I got a bill for $370, and the public utility told me if it's going at the existing rate, my next costs will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at first as his schedule was currently complete, but when he discovered just how much water bill I was paying since the leakage began, he agreed to assist me out on a Sunday morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his complete uniform and all the equipment. He discovered & marked the place of the leak for me and then even helped me shut down my main water valve. Easy-going and really courteous individual.</p>
