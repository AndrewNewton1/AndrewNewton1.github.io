<p>Carl Grimes - Carl has both the individual experience of how an unhealthy home created his own disabling health issues, plus professional experience in numerous markets working in the Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) field.

<p>As soon as standing water is removed, the objective or our drying equipment is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in areas where water has actually taken in (this will briefly increase the humidity in the affected rooms) and b) remove the moisture in the air with effective dehumidifiers. There may be times when the rate of evaporation is somewhat out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our tracking process includes checking ambient conditions both inside and out, and if we can benefit from low humidity outdoors, we may choose to open a window or door to momentarily purge" the damp air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly dependent on temperature as well, so cooling a space down with outdoor air can also set a drying task back days. We ask that you please inquire with our service technicians before you make any modifications if you have questions on this.</p>
