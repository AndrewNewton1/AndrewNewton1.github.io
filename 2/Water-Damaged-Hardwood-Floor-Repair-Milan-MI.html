These conditions can assist in determining what devices to use on any loss. Enthalpy and its subcomponents, latent and reasonable energy, can be determined by use of the Enthalpy Evaporation Evaluation Formula (E ³). ⁴ This formula accurately anticipates the energy assessment of ambient air and its relationship to multiple structure products and how they respond to each one and provide the best evaporation results. The higher the number, the quicker materials will dry. Utilizing this formula, desiccants are more practical if the outside grains per pound of wetness are lower.</p>
