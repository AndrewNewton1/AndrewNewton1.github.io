<p>Current Review: I needed an emergency water leak detection work done as water was gushing somewhere unidentified and water meter was jumping up like insane (I got a bill for $370, and the public utility told me if it's going at the present rate, my next costs will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at very first as his schedule was already full, however when he discovered just how much water bill I was paying considering that the leakage began, he consented to assist me out on a Sunday early morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his complete uniform and all the equipment. He found & marked the location of the leakage for me and after that even helped me closed down my primary water valve. Very polite and easy-going person.</p>
