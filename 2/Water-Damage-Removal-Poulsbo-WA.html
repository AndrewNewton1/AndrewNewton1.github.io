<p>Since typical building products are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold development in an indoor environment is normally related to water or wetness exposure and might be brought on by incomplete drying of flooring products (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can cause interior mold development. Water vapor commonly condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor goes through walls and ceilings, generally condensing throughout the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" identifies wetness from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as polished concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
