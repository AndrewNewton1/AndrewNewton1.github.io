<h3>Residential Fire Damage Restoration in Destin</h3>
<p>Keep in mind that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet when you are preparing large repair work. By minimizing the thickness here, it's much easier to hide long taped seams under several coats of joint substance. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet. In order to get an even, ended up look, it is essential to avoid joining bound edges to butt edges. Also remember that since wall studs are vertical, drywall is usually connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This helps reinforce the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical seams in the drywall that tend to be more obvious even when the task is completed.<p>
