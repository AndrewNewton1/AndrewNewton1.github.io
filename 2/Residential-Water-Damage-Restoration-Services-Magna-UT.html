Ceilings exposed to water damage are more at threat due to gravity: You don't want them drooping or collapsing. So, remove impacted ceiling panels or boards first.

<p>When wet, Wallboard acts like a sponge. Get rid of paneling, wallboard and plaster to at least the flood level. If soaked by infected floodwater, it can be an irreversible health risk and should be removed.
