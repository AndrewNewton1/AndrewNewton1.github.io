Ceilings exposed to water damage are more at threat due to gravity: You don't want them drooping or collapsing. So, remove impacted ceiling panels or boards first. If the ceiling leak is caused by a roofing system issue, it is essential to find the true source of the leakage, which might be someplace far removed from the water stain And take this time to ensure the water triggered no structural damage to beams or rafters.

<p>When wet, Wallboard acts like a sponge. Get rid of paneling, wallboard and plaster to at least the flood level. If soaked by infected floodwater, it can be an irreversible health risk and should be removed.
