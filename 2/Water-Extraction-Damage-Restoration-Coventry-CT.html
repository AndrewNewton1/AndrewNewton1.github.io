<p>Once standing water is removed, the goal or our drying equipment is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in areas where water has soaked up (this will momentarily increase the humidity in the impacted rooms) and b) eliminate the wetness in the air with effective dehumidifiers. There may be times when the rate of evaporation is slightly out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our monitoring procedure consists of checking ambient conditions both indoors and out, and if we can take advantage of low humidity outdoors, we may elect to open a window or door to temporarily purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is heavily dependent on temperature level as well, so cooling a space down with outside air can likewise set a drying project back days.

<p>Air Cleaning: Instantly we gear up the home with air scrubbers. We typically will set one system for every single two to three spaces, depending upon the size of the room. These systems have a consumption and outtake. The existing air is drawn through the consumption where it goes through three filters, one of which is a HEPA filter. These filters are tested and accredited to 99.99% HEPA effectiveness, which suggests that they remove at least 99.99% of particles as little 0.3 microns in size. The air that is released through the outtake has been cleaned and much of the odor got rid of. This procedure goes on for days. As you can picture, throughout several days, the air that can be found in through the intake is cleaner and cleaner with less smell so, with time and efficient air scrubbing, we start the air cleaning and deodorizing procedures.</p>
