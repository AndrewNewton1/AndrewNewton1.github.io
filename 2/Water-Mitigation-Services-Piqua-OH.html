<p>Mold can cause severe health concerns through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you might not understand is that many chemicals, including bleach, have been proven inadequate against eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it actually facilitates mold development. The chlorine particles stay on the surface and will just kill a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>Mold remediation ought to not simply eliminate a present development, but also guarantee mold doesn't find a way to come back. Our 10-year guarantee guarantees that the EPA-registered anti-microbial we utilize will keep mold from growing back after it is removed. The anti-microbial is non-toxic and water-based, so you don't require to have any worries about seeping, VOC emissions or other environmental or irritant concerns.
