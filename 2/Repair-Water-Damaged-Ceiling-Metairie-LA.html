Part of our monitoring process consists of inspecting ambient conditions both inside and out, and if we can make the most of low humidity outdoors, we may choose to open a window or door to briefly purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly dependent on temperature too, so cooling a room down with outside air can also set a drying project back days. We ask that you please inquire with our service professionals before you make any changes if you have concerns on this.</p>
