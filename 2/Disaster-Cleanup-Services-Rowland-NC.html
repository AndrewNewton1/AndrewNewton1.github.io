<p>Water intrusion into structures can be exceptionally devastating. We engaged a team of researchers at the University of Colorado once InstaScope was created. Led by Dr. Mark Hernandez, a globally recognized specialist on the biological elements of air pollution, this team was designated to verify and test the new technology. Needless to say, it passed with flying colors. Together, we were able to create a brand-new mold-assessment system for business consumers that, unlike any other approach or device, can provide clinically precise, area-by-area results-- and do so instantly. So when you consider all the threats of mold, InstaScope is an important tool to assist ensure the health of your home and the health of your family.</p>
<p>Because common structure materials are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold growth in an indoor environment is normally associated with water or moisture direct exposure and may be caused by insufficient drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can lead to interior mold development. Water vapor typically condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to grow. 8 This wetness vapor travels through walls and ceilings, usually condensing during the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" spots moisture from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
