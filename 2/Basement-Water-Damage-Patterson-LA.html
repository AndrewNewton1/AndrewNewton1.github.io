<p>As soon as standing water is gotten rid of, the objective or our drying devices is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in areas where water has absorbed (this will temporarily increase the humidity in the affected spaces) and b) eliminate the wetness in the air with powerful dehumidifiers. There may be times when the rate of evaporation is a little out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our monitoring process includes checking ambient conditions both inside your home and out, and if we can make the most of low humidity outdoors, we may elect to open a window or door to temporarily purge" the damp air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly dependent on temperature as well, so cooling a space down with outdoor air can likewise set a drying project back days. If you have questions on this, we ask that you please inquire with our service specialists prior to you make any modifications.</p>
