These conditions can help in identifying what equipment to use on any loss.

<p>Inspect the drywall to see just how much damage has been done. Heavily water-infiltrated wallboard will droop from ceilings or collapse to the touch. Remove all jeopardized drywall by hand or use the claw end of a hammer or a damaging bar to eliminate it.

When eliminating around the damaged area, use a keyhole saw to cut the hole into a square or rectangle-shaped shape. You can then make a patch with another piece of drywall for the repair.<p>
