<p>Keep in mind: For the purpose of this post, Mold Removal, Mold Remediation, Mold Abatement and Mold Mitigation are interchangeable terms that essentially suggest repairing a mold issue in a structure. However, it turned out that rice was still an "inferior" drying representative, coming behind not just silica gel-- the packages that come in the package with many electronics to keep moisture at bay throughout shipment and throughout a device's shelf life-- but also other products like oats and couscous.<p>
<p>We called them out to assess water damage in our kitchen area after we discovered our faucet was dripping. They fasted to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift cooking area for us in our living-room and transported away whatever else.  We were extremely pleased that we didn't need to raise a finger.  When they came back the next company day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were very expert and hardworking.  I couldn't believe they got so much done in one day!  Someone has actually come out every day to sign in and I feel great in their understanding and abilities to get the job done appropriately. I would advise them in a heart beat.<p>
<p>The other thing to keep in mind is the source of water. Dropping your phone in a puddle or the toilet is bad, however dropping it in the ocean, and you can kiss that phone farewell. Salt water is highly destructive and will damage a phone's components much quicker than freshwater. So beware when taking selfies on your luxury yacht.
