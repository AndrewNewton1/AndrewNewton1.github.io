<p>Experiencing a disaster that requires fire damage cleanup in your house or company is among the most destructive things that can happen to a person or a family. Molds comes in many different types; in reality, according to the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, there are probably tens of countless types of molds, if not more. Molds play a crucial function in breaking down plants, trees and leaves. While lots of molds are harmless, damaging types in enclosed locations can lead to respiratory distress, manifesting itself in symptoms that include stuffy noses and wheezing. The results will be more extreme for those who are allergic to that mold or have asthma. Molds responsible for breaking down natural products, like wood and leaves, can damage the structure of your home. Everyone has a hostility to that.</p>
<p>According to Lstiburek, the response was easy: It was a perfect storm"-- a mix that attorneys now allege came from pressure to construct much faster, an industrywide switch to lower-cost structure materials, and little federal government and contractor oversight. Add to that an environment like Pennsylvania's, where the typical yearly rains is around 41 inches-- and the potential for water damage was that much higher.</p>
