<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call a professional rapidly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. Black mold can be harmful to your health, primarily triggering respiratory problems. But in severe cases and for individuals with pre-existing health conditions, black mold can cause pneumonia.

<h3>Fire Damage Cleaning Services in Harvest</h3>
<p>A DIY mold remediation item that mold specialists usually suggest is borax - a white powder which you can purchase from the grocery, at the cleaning agent or laundry section.

There's no requirement to wash it off since borax will keep the mold from returning. However, do not utilize this cleaner on porous surface areas like drywall. Such materials soak up water quickly.
