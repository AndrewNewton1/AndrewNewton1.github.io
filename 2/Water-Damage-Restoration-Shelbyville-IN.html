<p>When water freezes, it expands, and that can be a problem for your home. Frozen water can trigger pipes to burst, causing costly and untidy repair.

Pay unique attention to pipes in basements, garages, the back of cabinets, and other locations that might not be getting the same amount of heat as other areas in your house. Wrapping them in a layer of insulation can go a long way in preventing a burst.</p>
