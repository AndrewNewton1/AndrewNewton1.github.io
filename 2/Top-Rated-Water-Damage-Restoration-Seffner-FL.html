In order to get an even, completed appearance, it's important to prevent signing up with bound edges to butt edges. Also remember that because wall studs are vertical, drywall is generally connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. When the job is finished, this helps reinforce the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical seams in the drywall that tend to be more obvious even.<p>
