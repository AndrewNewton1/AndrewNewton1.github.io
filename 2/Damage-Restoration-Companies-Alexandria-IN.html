<p>Recent Review: We called them out to evaluate water damage in our kitchen area after we found our faucet was dripping. They fasted to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift kitchen for us in our living room and carried away whatever else.  We were really delighted that we didn't need to lift a finger.  When they returned the next business day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were very professional and hardworking.  I could not believe they got so much carried out in one day!  Somebody has actually come out every day to check in and I feel confident in their knowledge and capabilities to finish the job correctly. I would recommend them in a heart beat.<p>

Water damage restoration is the last phase of restoring or bring back a home damaged by floodwaters. Dirt-crawl areas have ended up being a housing and service epidemic. By encapsulating your crawl area you can substantially minimize wetness, mold, radon gas, rising energy expense, structural damage, loss of storage bug, area and odor invasions.<p>
<p>9. Eliminate the home furnishings and floor covering. Clean your furniture and let dry thoroughly. Flooring is tough to save, specifically when flooded with contaminated water like river water or sewer water. You might be able to save your floor covering if you were flooded with clean water and it's bone dry within 24 hr. If not, rip it up. To prevent mold in the bathroom, make sure to open windows if you have them to improve ventilation and run the fan when showering, shaving or cleaning. Clean water off hard surfaces, like shower walls and sinks, and fix pipes leaks as soon as possible. Scrub mold from surfaces as quickly as it appears, then make sure to dry the area to prevent it from spreading.<p>
