There are a number of methods to avoid mold development.

Understanding the potential causes of water damage assists you make the right decision about what remediation services and products are needed.<p>
<p>Mold that is growing on basement walls or other surfaces may be scrubbed with one part bleach to eight parts water. Mold is a type of invasive fungis that may grow on surfaces inside your home. It varies in color and type, and is normally discovered in areas that have been subjected to moisture at some time in time, such as bathrooms or in locations around leaking pipelines. Before you start a job like this, provide the water damaged location a great clean. This is the textbook first step in any paint job, including fixing water damage on walls. We recommend using something like a Selleys Sugar Soap with a damp fabric and then permitting time for the area to dry.<p>
