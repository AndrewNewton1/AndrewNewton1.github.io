<p>Fire Damage is the most devastating sort of property damage that a family or company can experience. Once MacBook water damage has actually occurred, the liquid will likely make its method to the logic board and other components.

This is because of the metals oxidizing and gradually corroding. If there is a source of power available, such as a battery, which is supplying power to the system (even if the computer is off), the electrical current will communicate with the liquid and accelerate this rust procedure. This causes the copper and other metals to migrate throughout the board. If this rust process is not stopped, you will likely wind up with a really pricey paperweight.</p>
