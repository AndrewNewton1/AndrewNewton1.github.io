<p>Because common structure materials are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold development in an indoor environment is typically associated with water or wetness direct exposure and might be caused by incomplete drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can cause interior mold development. Water vapor commonly condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to grow. 8 This moisture vapor goes through ceilings and walls, typically condensing during the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" discovers wetness from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as refined concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
