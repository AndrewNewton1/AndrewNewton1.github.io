<p>Because common building products are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold growth in an indoor environment is usually connected to water or wetness direct exposure and might be triggered by insufficient drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can result in interior mold development. Water vapor commonly condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to grow. 8 This moisture vapor travels through walls and ceilings, generally condensing throughout the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" spots moisture from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as polished concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
