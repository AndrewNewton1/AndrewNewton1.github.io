<h3>Fire Restoration Experts in Midland</h3>
<p>Secure Non-Damaged Areas- Once containment barriers are established we will start eliminating the damp dry wall and begin to dry inside the walls. If there is damaged carpet, we will pull the pad that is under the carpet, which allows the carpet to dry. We will also move furnishings out of the damp locations to guarantee that all excess moisture inside a wall or under a floor is dried, so no mold issues arise later on.<p>
<p>Also, because bleach is mostly water, on permeable surface areas, such as wood or drywall, the water in the bleach is quickly absorbed by the product. So, while you may have rubbed out or blemished the surface mold to the point that you can't see it, you've actually provided lots of water to grow back and potentially spread out the mold beneath the surface. If there is a great deal of mold growth, consult the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's guidance:" Mold Remediation in Schools and Commercial Structures ".  versions of these and other guidance documents are readily available on the EPA's Publications on Mold webpage If the musty material is not quickly cleanable, such as drywall, carpet cushioning and insulation, then removal and replacement may be necessary.<p>
