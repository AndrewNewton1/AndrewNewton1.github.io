<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (likewise called Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become water-damaged or moist. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some pressures of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other elements. When mycotoxins are present, they occur in both living and dead mold spores, and may be present in materials that have actually ended up being polluted with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from becoming air-borne. When the mold dies and dries up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to end up being airborne.</p>
