<p>If smoke and fire damage has actually affected your belongings, we will work with you and your insurer to determine what can be brought back, and what will be an insurance replacement claim. For items that can be restored, we use ultrasonic cleaning to restore your damaged valuables. For this, we used Zinsser's Water Based Peel-Stop What this does is act like a glue which permeates into porous surface area, preventing water from seeping back through. Essentially, it makes the area strong again and protects the surface from future water damage. After you have used the Peel-Stop, enable an hour of drying time.<p>

When they came back the next organisation day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were very professional and hardworking.  I could not believe they got so much carried out in one day!  Somebody has come out every day to sign in and I feel confident in their understanding and capabilities to get the job done effectively. I would suggest them in a heart beat.<p>
