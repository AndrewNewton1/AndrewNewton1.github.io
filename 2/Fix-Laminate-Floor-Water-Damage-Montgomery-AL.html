It is the gradual and sluggish deterioration of materials (normally metals) by chain reaction within their environment, In this case the deterioration occurs when you integrate electrical power, water, oxygen and metal, creating iron oxide (or what is more commonly known as rust). There is no reliable schedule for this procedure to occur; a MacBook's internal elements usually begin corroding instantly after the spill, however in many cases your Mac can function normally for days or weeks without showing any apparent sign of a problem.
