<p>Water invasion into structures can be extremely damaging. Jake and his people were fantastic in assisting us make it through flooding from Hurricane Florence. They fasted to get to the house and started drying our soaked crawlspace instantly. They came back every day (often twice a day) to monitor and adjust the fans and dehumidifiers to optimize the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists.
