Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at very first as his schedule was currently full, but when he learnt just how much water costs I was paying considering that the leakage began, he consented to assist me out on a Sunday early morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his complete uniform and all the equipment. He marked the area & discovered of the leakage for me and after that even assisted me shut down my primary water valve.
