<p>Water invasion into buildings can be extremely destructive. Jake and his guys were remarkable in assisting us survive flooding from Hurricane Florence. They were quick to get to your house and started drying out our soaked crawlspace immediately. They came back every day (often two times a day) to keep an eye on and change the fans and dehumidifiers to make the most of the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They explained whatever they were doing along the way and also were really helpful in collaborating efforts with the insurance coverage adjuster.
