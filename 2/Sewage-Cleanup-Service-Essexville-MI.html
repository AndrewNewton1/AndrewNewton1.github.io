<p>Mold can trigger serious health concerns through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you may not understand is that a lot of chemicals, including bleach, have been proven inadequate versus eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it actually assists in mold development. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface and will just kill a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>Since typical structure products can sustaining mold development and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold development in an indoor environment is generally related to water or moisture direct exposure and might be triggered by incomplete drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can result in interior mold development. Water vapor typically condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to flourish. 8 This moisture vapor goes through walls and ceilings, generally condensing throughout the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" identifies moisture from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as refined concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
