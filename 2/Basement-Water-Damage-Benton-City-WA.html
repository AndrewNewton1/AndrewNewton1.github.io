<p><center><img src="https://waterdamageimages.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/restoration-services.jpg" alt="" width="990" height="350"></center><p>
<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. Water damage, water invasion, building envelope issues, and building flaws are an extremely major matter. Here in Portland, Oregon, Vancouver, Washington and the surrounding areas are experiencing many problems due to dripping doors and windows, water and wind driven rain damage. Senior living centers, homes, condos, townhomes, hotels, commercial buildings are particularly susceptible to these problems as typically the builder subcontracts the exterior envelope work and wall assembly process, therefore leading to corners and expenses being cut.</p>
<p>To avoid mold and practice adequate kitchen maintenance, open windows to improve ventilation and run the hood vent when cooking and cleaning. Clean water from tough surfaces, and repair dripping faucets as soon as possible. Constantly make certain your tableware and serving dishes are dry before storing them to keep mold from multiplying in cabinets. Scrub mold from surface areas as quickly as it appears, then be sure to dry the area to avoid it from spreading.</p>

<p>Fixing damage should be the primary step you take to get your home looking its finest. If a part of your house requires structural repair after a storm, a fire or water damage, get that repaired before doing any cosmetic work.
