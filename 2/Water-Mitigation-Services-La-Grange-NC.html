<p>When left alone, mold can cause serious health concerns through airborne pathogens. What you might not understand is that the majority of chemicals, including bleach, have been proven ineffective versus removing mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it really helps with mold development. The chlorine particles remain on the surface and will only eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>Before your home has actually dried out, scrub floorings and woodwork with a stiff brush, plenty of water, a cleaning agent and disinfectant. Carpeting soaked by infected floodwater needs to be gotten rid of and discarded unless it can be sanitized at a commercial facility for a cost considerably less than replacement. Vinyl floor covering and floor tile might require to be eliminated to permit drying of subfloor.</p>
